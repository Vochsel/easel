# Structure

Easel is mostly a set of vanilla JS/CSS/HTML utilities. However the rubber hits the road with the various delivery implementations.

Easel supports a basic level of usage in `easel.js`, however, more advanced functionality requires some level of server work. PHP is the primary choice here, due to the fact that most web servers support it. However in the future a node.js wrapper may be provided.
